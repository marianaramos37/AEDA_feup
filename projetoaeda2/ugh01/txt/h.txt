Hi,
about 1 year ago (2 months into my relationship) my boyfriend broke up with me (with no specific reason, he said he didn't feel the same way I did). At that time I started my spiritual journey and I manage to attract him back using the law of attraction, focusing on myself and growing as an individual. We started a new love relationship that lasted for about 9 months. Now he broke up with me again (suddently, saying that I have more to offer than he ever will and that I have more feelings for him than the other way around). And I'm just lost! I don't know if I should attract him back into my life. or just give up on this connection. I do love him. And I planned a "future" in my mind with him, imagining us growing up together. I don't know if I should follow that "dream" of being with him and use the law of attraction for that end, or if I should just stop thinking about him in that way and move on to make new connections with other people.
Please help.
Wih love , Mariana (from Portugal)
